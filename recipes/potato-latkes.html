    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really
      wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is
      honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second
      batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and
      always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.
